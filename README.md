Contents and site generator for [freeston.me](https://freeston.me)


## Can I use this for myself?

Licence information is provided on a per-file basis where applicable - the short version is all the source code to generate the site is available under the MIT Licence, but the content is not.

I wrote this as something I could easily hack on and modify to suit my needs. It's not designed as a reusable library, but feel free to use any parts of the code as the basis for your own custom-built generator. If you'd like something a bit more solid that also uses babashka, I recommend looking at @borkdude's [quickblog](https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog).
