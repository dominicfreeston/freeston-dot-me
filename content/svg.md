# The `freeston` XML/SVG Namespace

You've probably found this page because you've looked at the raw content of an SVG generated by some of my code and found this URL.

Fun fact: it didn't need to be a URL and this page doesn't need to exist!

> "Note that namespace names are just strings, so the fact that the SVG namespace name also looks like a URI isn't important. URIs are commonly used because they are unique, the intention is not to "link" somewhere."
- [Mozilla's Namespaces Crash Course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course).

I'm using this namespace to include extra metadata to the generated SVGs to make it easier to trace their origin and potentially recreate them if necessary.
