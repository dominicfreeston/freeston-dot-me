I took the perpendicular lines from yesterday's and did something a bit different with them, looking for a more flowing feel. The key change at the end was to dramatically increase the number of lines and reduce the opacity - a trick which I find can be quite effective at generating pleasing textures[^textures], but for some reason often feels like cheating. I think it's because a lot of my work is intended to be plotted, limiting me mostly to solid lines[^pens], a restriction I'm not bound to for this project.

[^textures]: The background uses a similar technique, as so do many of the previous pieces in the series.
[^pens]: Though depending on the pen used, some interesting layering effects can be achieved.
