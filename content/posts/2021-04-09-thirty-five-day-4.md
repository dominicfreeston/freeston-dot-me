Today, experimenting with colours and leaning even more into the variable circle packing for placing the various shapes throughout the canvas. As with [yesterday's drawing](/posts/2021-04-08-thirty-five-day-3/), a few of the larger shapes' locations are hard-coded (though the actual shape is dictated by the flow field) - a trade-off between the ability for the code to surprise me and my ability to consciously shape the output.
