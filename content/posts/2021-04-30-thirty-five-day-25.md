My process today has consisted mostly of generating a bunch of pieces and choosing my favourite - one that feels more like curation than creation at this point. Whilst the range of outputs is now quite varied, it's also incredibly inconsistent and difficult to refine when something interesting pops up. I think it's a constant tension with generative art.

I see a couple of directions to take for the remaining 10 days this project. Now that I can capture some of the high level parameters that led to a particular drawing, I could either try and figure out what combinations tend to lead to better outcomes and make these more likely, or I could use it as a way to freeze a particular combination to then refine until I'm satisfied.

Of course another possibility is to try and incorporate colour again, which feels rather daunting when there's already so many variables. Let' see where tomorrow takes me.
