Life gets in the way! I spent this evening playing [Mothership](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/), a horror-in-space tabletop RPG that involved spooky floating hair and emergency lighting, so I hacked at my code whilst playing and tried to channel that. Not my most thought-through piece, but something a bit different again using similar techniques.
