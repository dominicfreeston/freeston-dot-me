I started off tonight feeling completely uninspired and aimless - without the challenge in place I would have not produced anything today. And yet I've managed to create what might be my favourite of the series so far. Once again I've reused many of the elements from previous pieces but reworked and combined them in different ways. Many of the previous days have evoked the physical world - clouds, flowers, stars, planets - but to me today's piece doesn't do any of that, it stands on its own.
