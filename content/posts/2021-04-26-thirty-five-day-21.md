Some minor tweaks to the code today, trying to reign in the possibilities just a bit to get a higher proportion of results I like. The output I chose is much more minimal than most in this series but has a lovely feel to it and fits nicely with the type of plotter art I generally like to make. I feel like I'm at another crossroad between looking to bring in more colours and layered textures, or continue expanding on the possibilities within the constraint of line drawings.
