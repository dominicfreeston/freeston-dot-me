Today's output is from essentially unchanged code - at least none of the possible outcomes have changed, no new feature and no tweaking of the parameters.

What I have started to do is centralise some of they key decision points into a structure that I then use throughout the code. This will help me make sense of which properties are the most impactful and what combinations of parameters create the most interesting outputs.
