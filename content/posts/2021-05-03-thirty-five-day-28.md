It's not exactly a newfound revelation that using colour well is difficult, [perhaps even more so in generative works](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2021/color-arrangement-in-generative-art). I've been playing around with alternative colour spaces in the hope, perhaps rather naively, of being able to find operations that consistently generate great combinations from a base randomly selected colour. It hasn't been going particularly well! Today's colours were the outcome of manual trial and error.

Whilst a little bit of randomness for small colour variations can add texture and depth and the exact location of each colour can be left to the whims of the algorithm, I think I'm ready to accept that selecting the colour palette of a piece is something I'll need to do the old fashion way and continue working at.
