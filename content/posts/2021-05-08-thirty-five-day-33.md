I've refined, biased and restricted the colour code so that it mostly generates a pleasing colour scheme with a somewhat consistent style, whilst also keeping a good degree of variation.

I've started to identify combinations of features that tend to lead disappointing results and I'm hoping to spend some time tomorrow putting a few more restrictions to stop these from happening. I'm actually fairly hopeful that I might end the challenge on Monday with a program that somewhat reliably outputs interesting results.
