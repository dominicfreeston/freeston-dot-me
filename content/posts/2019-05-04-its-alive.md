It's been a long time, but I have a website again. It's not much, but it's mine. I think it's a tech blog, time will tell.

### About me

I'm an iOS developer by day, so I'd expect some related topics. I've been toying with Clojure for a little while now. I use [Quil](http://www.quil.info/) to generate line drawings for a pen plotter. Through Clojure I started using Emacs which has kind of become a hobby [in itself](https://github.com/dominicfreeston/emacs-config). I'm also quite into games, board and video. I sometimes play around making them in Lua using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) or [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

### This site

This site is generated using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/), a nifty static site generator written in Clojure. It ships as a [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) template, so it was easy to get started. I didn't use Jekyll or Hugo or something else you've heard of because I'm a hipster, and it's more likely I'll tinker with it.

The [template](https://github.com/dominicfreeston/freeston-dot-me) for the site is lovingly hand-crafted by me in a minimalist style. That's to say, I created an empty folder and added files until Cryogen stopped giving me errors. I copied over bits of the existing templates until the content I wanted appeared, then added just enough CSS to make my eyes stop hurting. It's unlikely to work with a different config.
