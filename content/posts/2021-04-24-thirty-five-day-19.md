Today I gave the code the option of warping the circles and/or replacing the circle with parallel lines. The large and small circles are treated separately, with the inclusion of the large circles being randomised. I'm already getting quite a bit of variation - some good, some bad, some surprising. My choice for today neatly showcases some of the new possibilities.
