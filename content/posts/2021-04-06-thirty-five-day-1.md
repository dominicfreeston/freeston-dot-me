After the long Easter weekend and another day off ahead of me, I was feeling rather at peace this morning and so for day one of [my challenge](/posts/2021-04-05-thirty-five/) I channelled the beautiful skies outside my window.

I'd been feeling the pressure of doing something "good" from the start, so I started developing the code a couple of days ago. I combined a couple of common generative art techniques which I've experimented with before - [circle packing](https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/circle-packing/) and [flow fields](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2020/flow-fields) - using points around the circles as launch point for flow lines. I didn't really have a sense of what I wanted to achieve but enjoyed tweaking various parameters to get quite varied results.

I took things in a different direction today, making use of much longer, semi-transparent white lines over a blue background and warping the circles so that they blend into the overall shape. The result feels like a cohesive whole with a satisfying sense of movement.
