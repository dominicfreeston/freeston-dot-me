As planned, I added a few restrictions to the code so that a few particular combinations of parameters that consistently lead to bad outputs now simply can't happen. With one more day to go to complete my challenge, the process is very much one of curation, but unlike [nine days ago](/posts/2021-04-30-thirty-five-day-25/), the number of interesting outputs is much higher and and I'm able to refine them a bit if required (though I haven't felt the need to do so for a few days now).
