I've been exploring the kind of colour palettes I can generate dynamically using [a technique](https://iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm) I came across yesterday. Although it's still difficult to get varied but consistently attractive palettes, it is indeed a good way to get exposed to a wide range of options. I can select either a colour palette or the composition that I like and then continue exploring possibilities from there. Today's piece however, came out of the code fully formed.
