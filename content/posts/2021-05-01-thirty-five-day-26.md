After generating a few drawings, I picked the most interesting one and tweaked the code to refine one of the aspects of the piece - namely, the circles at the top of the piece are now of varied size and warped to not be perfect circle, giving it a more organic and balanced feel.

Depending on the structure of the program, refining a particular aspect of a piece can be tricky as there are so many random elements. Changing in which order those random decisions are made can completely change the piece. Over the last couple of days I've purposefully rearranged the code so that decisions that affect the overall composition happen before decisions that affect the details, making it more likely I can target just the part of the program I want to modify without completely altering the result.
